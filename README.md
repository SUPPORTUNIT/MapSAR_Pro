# MapSAR_Pro
1. Download a zip copy of the template
2. Extract the download into your root directory (C:\).  This will create the following folder:
    C:\MapSAR_Pro-master
3. Rename the folder to C:\MapSAR_Pro
4. You should now have the following folder structure:
    C:\MapSAR_Pro
       - Documentation
       - Forms
       - MapSAR_Pro_Template
       - Tools
5. You can delete .gitattributes and README.md (optional).  It is important that you don't have any additional folders between the root drive (C:\) location and the MapSAR_Pro folder (it should look the same as in step 4).
6. To create a new incident, copy the MapSAR_Pro_Template to a new location.
7. Open the MapSAR_Pro.aprx file in the template folder in ArcGIS Pro
8. Switch to the "TASK" tab (bottom left).  Select "Utilities", then "Create New Incident"
